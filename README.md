This is my first change

Inspiration Source: Dynamic Effects of Light and Shadow
On one occasion when I was walking out of my dormitory building, I noticed the sunlight pouring through the leaves on the lawn, glistening in the breeze. This technique is able to create a strong visual impact in my projects, especially when depicting characters or objects whisking around, the change in light and shadow can enhance the depth and layering of the image. I would like to apply this technique to enrich my designs by adding visual appeal and interactivity.

Coding Technique: Canvas API and WebGL
The Canvas API and WebGL provide efficient 2D and 3D rendering capabilities, allowing us to create dynamic light and shadow effects that enhance visual performance. WebGL's shader techniques can simulate the light transitions observed in films, especially the shadow transitions that occur as objects move. This could be useful for adding depth and realism to my project.
